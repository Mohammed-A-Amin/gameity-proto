      <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
      
      <p>Each year, the parents of more than 16,000 children age 0-19 in the U.S. will hear the words “your child has cancer.” Across all ages,
         ethnic groups, and socio-economics, this disease remains the number one cause of death by disease in children. Despite major advances – from an overall
          survival rate of 10% just 50 years ago to nearly 85% today, for many rare cancers, the survival rate is much lower. Furthermore, the number of diagnosed cases annually has not declined in nearly 20 years. 
        There are approximately 429,000 adult survivors of children’s cancer in the United States.</p> <br>

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>Gameity brings together the great cause of charity and gaming, uniting them together. We are giving a chance to gamers who want to give back to their
        community by not only donating, but also playing games for the purpose of charity. We strive to help those charities gain more attention to be able to gain more money
        to help those in need.

          <p>Hello, my name is Kevin and I am currently a Junior at LAUSD/USC MAE Magnet School. Ever since I was able to read and understand numbers, my favorite subject has been math. I have developed an ambition for the subject of math and am now taking AP Calculus as a Junior. I plan to attend a four/five-year college in order to work for a major related to the STEM field such as Computer Science. To me, math is my favorite subject and engineering is just a great way to put my math skills to work. Currently, I am an aspiring software engineer who is motivated to keep thriving through the barriers of life.</p>
